# ðŸ’» GAN based Generation Project
#### Origin Project: AI-Based Art Creation (DCGAN & ViT)
#### Data Preprocessing and Data Modeling in origin project
***
## âœ” AI-Based Art Creation project has main objectices
>* ### Minimizing Damage to Existing Artwork and Creating New Art through Restoration.   
>* ### Developing an Artwork Classifier to Systematically Manage and Organize Newly Generated Artworks.   
  
 ***
## âœ” Main part in project
>* ### Data Preprocessing
>     >#### a) [Using WIKIART GAN Dataset provided by Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasoonkottarathil/wikiart-gan)
>     >#### b) [Using Art Images Dataset provided by Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedownhill/art-images-drawings-painting-sculpture-engraving)
>     >#### c) Using Custom Dataset : Efficiently Processing Large-Scale Image Datasets and Handling Errors Effectively
>     >#### d) Deep Image Prior 
>     >#### e) DCGAN - Image Generation through Model Training
>     >#### d) ViT - Image Classification


***
## âœ” Improvement points
 >* #### Identifying Effective Methods for Enhancing Model Performance in Image Generation
 >* #### Subdividing the Categories of the Image Dataset for an Expanded Dataset Classification
 >* #### Finding Effective Methods for Improving Model Performance in Image Generation
 >* #### Attemptes to tune the optimal hyperparameters
